Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.

Unfortunately, Jack and Jill went to the wrong well. This well had dangerous poison in its water and it poisoned all the villagers. This caused the military to take action and they launched a tactical nuke targeting Jack and Jill.
