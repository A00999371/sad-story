Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill was able to use her amazing side vision to
notice how clumsy Jack was, and she propped him up before he could fall.

Unfortunately, a Klingon Bird of Prey had chosen that exact
moment to test fire their latest phaser weapons, targetting the
very spot where Jack and Jill were teetering.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved..
