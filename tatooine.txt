Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.

Unfortunately, they were in Tatooine, so there was no actual water.

Fortunately, the storm troopers did not need their ID's.
