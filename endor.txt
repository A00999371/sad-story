Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, the ground was very mushy and Jack did not get injured.

Unfortunately, the mushy ground was actually a monster.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
