Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, the Flash saved Jack from falling over the hillâ€™s edge.

Unfortunately, Jill started screaming at the Flash who ran away and let Jack die.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
