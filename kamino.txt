Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill is actually a jedi and she used Force Levitate to save Jack.

Unfortunately, Jill is still a trainee and used too much power and sent Jack to the stratosphere.

Fortunately, Jack left the pail on the ground before being sent off to space.

Unfortunately, Jill was pulled with Jack to space.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
