Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Mark, a farmer, was there to help Jack back to his feet.

Unfortunately, Patrick, a thief, tripped Mark over, who got injured badly.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
