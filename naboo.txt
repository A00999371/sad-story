Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, aliens invaded and distored gravity so that for the few seconds which Jack tripped gravity was reversed and jack did not fall.

Unfortunately, the brief period of reversed gravity caused Jill to be thrown upwards into space. 

Fortunately, Mark was able to talk his way out of a dangerous situation saving Jack again.

Unfortuntely, Jill called TECH SUPPORT, and TECH SUPPORT was useless and sleeping.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
