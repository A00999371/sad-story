Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.


Unfortunately, it is a raining day.

Fortunately, they bring the umbrella.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Amrit was there to save Jack.

Unfortunately, Amrit tripped over the same root.

Fortunately, aliens invaded and distored gravity so that for the few seconds which Jack tripped gravity was reversed and jack did not fall.

Unfortunately, he hurt his ankle.

Fortunately, Jill is a medic and fixed his ankle.

Unfortunately, the aliens destroyed most of the earth and so the earth is being hurled toward the earth.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
