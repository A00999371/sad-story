Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill was able to use her amazing side vision to
notice how clumsy Jack was, and she propped him up before he could fall.

Unfortunately,the village is vary far from the hill, and the hill is very steep, when Jack arrived to village, only 1 percent of water was left in the container.


Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
